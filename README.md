# LLM-App-for-Junior-Developer
Description
Project Background 

Large Language Model-based software development tools emerged with the focus on improving productivity and efficiency of software developers. For senior developers, LLM tools like GitHub Copilot and Tabnine can be extremely helpful. Even with potential AI hallucination, their experience supports them filtering incorrect suggestions and guiding those LLM tools towards the correct solution. However, junior developers do not have this same experience. Potential overreliance on AI is one of the concerns that it may diminish their potential improvement as developers by tailoring essential learning opportunities. This is also a concern of many educators in Computing Education. For this reason, it is relevant the development of LLM tools that understand junior developers' needs, for example, adjusting tone and incentivizing critical thinking.  

Project Description 

 

The project aims to develop an AI tool that can provide guidance and suggestions to junior software developers. It needs to adjust the tone and explanations in a way that junior software developers may not just understand but also learn from, improving their development skills. 

 

Project Requirements  

Process requirements: 

● Requirements elicitation for AI tool personalized for junior developers

● Analyse and prioritise the requirements 

● Requirements specification (functional and non-functional requirements)

 

Functional requirements: 

● Tool design  

● AI suggestions accompanied by questions, checking developers understand

● The tool should contact an senior developer, using email registered in database, if notice junior developer stuck in a problem 

Non-Functional requirements: 

● Implementation of data protection measures for user privacy 

● Scalability of the tool 

● Responsiveness across both mobile and web platforms 

It is expected that we will do this in a number of agile sprints. Each sprint will involve 

● Build/revise product backlog 

● Prioritise backlog items 

● Identify top items that can be implemented to create/extend MVP 

● Implement MVP 

● Deploy MVP for evaluation by industry practitioners/SE students 

● Evaluate MVP and feed results into next iteration of product backlog
